# hello-world
initial test repository for Tanya Ulmer
Tanya is confused about what to focus on
should she follow a literary path 
or force herself to learn more code
maybe paying someone to teach her code will make her more serious
she likes the guaranteed job out of Udacity, but isn't sure she can make it through
and is unsure about amassing more debt
so she thinks perhaps writing a crappy but lucrative novel first might finance it
but isn't the tech job supposed to finance the writing period for a less crappy novel?
